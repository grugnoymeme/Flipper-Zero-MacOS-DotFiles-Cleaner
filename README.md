# Flipper-Zero-MacOS-DotFiles-Cleaner
A simple zsh/bash script to run everytime you mount your FLIPPER SD in your MacOS computer, that cleans up all the hidden “._dotfiles” that MacOS creates, as log of settings and apps (like for example Time Machine and others), on your SD Card when you mount it.
